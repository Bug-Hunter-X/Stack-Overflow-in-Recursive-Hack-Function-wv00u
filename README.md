# Stack Overflow in Recursive Hack Function

This repository demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function written in Hack.  The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.  When the input number is large, the recursive calls exceed the maximum recursion depth allowed, leading to a stack overflow error.

The solution demonstrates how to avoid this error by using iterative approach instead of recursion.
